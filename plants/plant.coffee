# generic plant definition
# A plant is constructed with
#  - a reference to the game (see ../game.coffee)
#  - a reference to the atom (game toolkit by nornagon), 
#  - a seed - an object with a .number property which is a float of any value (0.0 - 1.0 maybe a nice range?)

# plants expect to have their draw function called on a canvas which has already been translated and rotated in to position.
# A plant expect the ground to be at 0,0, and grows upward (e.g. towards 0,-X)
# draw is called with args:
#  - growth cycle - a number between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the life cycle of the plant.
#  - time - current time in seconds - basically; e.g. (Date.now() / 1000)
